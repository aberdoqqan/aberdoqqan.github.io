        <h2>About Me</h2> <br>
        <p>I am a first year student at Computer Education and Instructional Tech. dept. at Middle East Technical University.</p>
        <p>I have been good with computers since my childhood. It influenced me to choose this department. I am curious and learn quickly.</p>
        <p>Generally, I follow motorsports in my spare time. Then, I often attend guitar courses to improve myself in music.</p>
        <p>I read books and go to the cinema to improve my general knowledge. Although, my preferences are generally science fiction, I also try to watch a drama movies.</p>
        <p>I try to participate in school communities as much as I can. METU Studious and Young Entrepreneurs Society are among the communities I have visited.</p>
